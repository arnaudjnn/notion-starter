## Custom theme

We use Chakra for styling. To modify your page's look, you can edit the theme in `/theme.js`. Read the [Chakra docs](https://next.chakra-ui.com/docs/theming/theme) to view all the changes you can make. For example, you can change the primary color like this:

```jsx
export default {
  colors: {
    primary: 'gold',
    secondary: '#1D254F',
    grey: {
      100: '#E7EBF0',
      200: '#FAFAFA',
      300: '#8A8AA3'
    }
    // ...
  },
}
```
